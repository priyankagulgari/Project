# Project
Developed a machine learning project to predict customer churn for a bank.
- Explored and cleaned the dataset; addressed missing values and converted categorical data to numerical format.
- Implemented machine learning algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree and Support Vector Machine.
- Conducted comprehensive model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score and ROC-AUC score to evaluate metrics.
- Utilized data visualization techniques including correlation, heatmaps and ROC curves, to effectively communicate findings and model performance.
